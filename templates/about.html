                The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's
                interest in
                recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely
                Mountain when
                Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the
                Shire,
                Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable
                to force.
                Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves
                from rash
                action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had
                planned to
                leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.
